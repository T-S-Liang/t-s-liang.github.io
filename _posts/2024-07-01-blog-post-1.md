The following Python script could be used for downloading the complete large model from huggingface.

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

snapshot_download(repo_id='lambdalabs/sd-image-variations-diffusers',
                  repo_type='model',
                  local_dir='./model',
                  resume_download=True)
```

If you're downloading models in mainland China, replace the `HF-ENDPOINT with the following command:

```shell
export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
```
